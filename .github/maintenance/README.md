# Reviewed maintenance queue

Six independently useful changes for photobooth, prepared from source on 2026-10-10. The five repositories rotate over 2026-10-10–2026-11-08; this repo publishes on the due dates in plan.json.

The workflow runs at 01:17 UTC (09:17 Philippine time), using this repository's GITHUB_TOKEN. No AI key or personal access token is stored. GitHub may delay scheduled runs.

Only one due change is applied per run. Existing destination files or changed source fingerprints cause a safe skip; force pushes are never used. The commit includes a state receipt for idempotency. Outside the window it performs no writes. A missed run can catch up one pending change per subsequent run within the window. The schedule remains visible after the window but becomes a no-op; disable the workflow in Actions to stop those no-op jobs.

Manual runs default to a dry run; select apply to publish a due change. Runs use the default branch. These commits add maintenance tools and contributor/operations guidance; they do not claim browser-tested UI changes. Syntax CI is deliberately labeled and does not prove TypeScript correctness, provider connectivity, camera access or live downloads.
